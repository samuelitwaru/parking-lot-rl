in the docs folder, create the following md files relating to the project:

1. problem fomulation: Real-world Problem: Clear definition of a problem suited for RL (e.g., resource allocation, dynamic pricing, autonomous navigation). MDP Definition: Formal definition of the State space (S), Action space (A), Reward function (R), and Transition Dynamics (P).

2. Algorithm Choice: Justification for the chosen RL algorithm (e.g., DQN)

3. Simulation & Training: 
      Environment Setup:Description of the simulation environment, 
      Hyperparameter Tuning:Discussion of critical hyperparameters and an initial tuning strategy. 
      Evaluation Metrics: Definition of specific metrics for agent performance
