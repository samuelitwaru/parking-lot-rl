create a parking lot environment reinforcement training simulation with pygame visualization. the parking lot will be a grid and for each step, the cars will be randomly assigned to different grids. theses grids
will be marked as occupied, and the rest as unoccupied.

In training the model, a free parking space will be identified by randomly picking a grid. if the grid picked is occupied, then there is a negative reward. 
if the grid picked is unoccupied, then there is a positive reward. bonus reward will calculated according to how close the unoccupied grid picked is to the parking lot entry. the closer the grid picked to the entry,
the higher the bonus reward since the aim project objective is to minimize time spent to park for drivers. 

for every step there will be a queue of cars randomly generated coming in to park. when a car has parked, a time period random time period is assigned to the car and once it has counted down to 0, the grid is rendered as unoccuped.
